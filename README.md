## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally on your machine, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` installed.

Follow these steps:

The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). The server features hot-reloading, so any changes you make will be reflected instantly in your browser.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a standard component-based architecture to keep the code organized and reusable.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Editing the Code

You have several options for editing the project's code:

1.  **Using a Local IDE:** For more extensive changes, follow the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) guide to run the project locally. You can use any code editor, like VS Code.
2.  **Using GitHub:** You can edit files directly on GitHub or use GitHub Codespaces for a cloud-based development environment.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This Vite + React project can be easily deployed to any modern static hosting provider. Popular free options include **Vercel**, **Netlify**, and **GitHub Pages**.

Typically, the deployment process involves:
1.  Pushing your code to a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).
2.  Connecting your repository to a hosting service.
3.  Configuring the build settings (usually auto-detected for Vite).

The hosting service will then automatically build and deploy your project, providing you with a live URL.

## üîó Using a Custom Domain

Once your site is deployed, you can connect a custom domain (e.g., `bondedbeadz.com`) through your hosting provider's dashboard.

This process generally requires you to update the DNS records (e.g., an `A` or `CNAME` record) with your domain registrar to point your domain to the hosting service.
